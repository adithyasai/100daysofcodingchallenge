# Day 1 Challenge

## Day 1 Goal: Understanding GitHub and Create a GitHub Account

Welcome to Day 1 of the 100 Days Coding Challenge! Today's goal is to familiarize yourself with GitHub and create your GitHub account.

### Real-World Scenario:

Before delving into Git concepts, let's consider a real-world scenario. Imagine you're the core organizer for the upcoming cultural fest in your college, and the renowned director Rajamouli is attending. Currently, you and other committee members are collaborating on the script preparation. How would you approach this?

Think it through.

You might initially gather together, take a sheet of paper, and create a rough draft by aggregating ideas. However, is this approach feasible, scalable, and reliable?

Think it through.

No, it's not. Here are the problems encountered:

- **Scheduling Issues:** It's challenging to have all committee members available at the same time.
- **Lack of Version Control:** The initial content can be easily overwritten by new changes, with no record of the history of alterations.
- **Tight Coupling:** This approach leads to a tightly coupled process, making collaboration cumbersome.

Can we improve this approach?

Think it through.

Certainly. You could upgrade to a file system instead of using paper. However, think about the potential problems with this approach.

Can we still improve the process?

Yes, by introducing Git.

**Git Definition:** Git is a distributed version control system that enables efficient collaboration in software development projects.

**Uses of Git:**

- Tracking changes in source code.
- Facilitating collaboration among multiple developers.
- Managing different versions of a project.

**Branching Strategy:** Consider the diagram below:

### Your Goals for Today:

1. **Explore GitHub:**

   - Visit the [GitHub website](https://github.com/) and take a tour of the platform.
   - Familiarize yourself with key features, such as repositories, issues, and pull requests.

2. **Create a GitHub Account:**

   - If you don't have a GitHub account, [create one](https://github.com/join).
   - Follow the steps to set up your account, choosing a username, adding your email, and setting a secure password.

3. **Verify Your Email:**
   - After creating your account, check your email for a verification link from GitHub. Click on the link to complete the process.

### Why GitHub?

GitHub simplifies collaboration, allows for easy tracking of changes, and provides a platform for showcasing your coding projects. As you progress through this challenge, you'll harness the power of GitHub to share your code, contribute to repositories, and engage with the global coding community.

### Next Steps:

By now, you should understand what GitHub is, why it's essential for coding projects, and you should have your GitHub account. If you're already aware and have an account, congratulations! Mark today as completed.
