**What's a Commit?**
In simple terms, a commit is like taking a snapshot of your project at a specific moment. When you commit changes, you're saving the current state of your code. It's a way of saying, "Hey, GitHub, remember this version because it's important!" Each commit has a message that explains what you did, making it easier for you and others to understand the changes you made.

### Assignment:
