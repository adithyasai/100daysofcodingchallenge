# Day 5 Challenge: Understanding Branches and Pull Requests

## Day 5 Goal: Learn About Branches and How to Use Pull Requests

Welcome to Day 5 of the 100 Days Coding Challenge! Today, we'll explore the concept of branches in Git and how they can help you manage collaborative projects effectively.

### Scenario: The Branch Solution

Imagine you're working on a repository with a group of 4 members. Unfortunately, a friend accidentally overwrote the changes you made and deployed them, causing confusion. In such cases, branches come to the rescue. You can create a separate branch, work on your changes, and then merge them back to the main branch when ready.

### Your Goals for Today:

1. **Create a New Branch:**

   - In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the root directory of your cloned repository.
   - Run `git checkout -b day5` to create and switch to a new branch named `day5`.
   OR
   - You can also create a new branch from Github GUI, Click on `New branch`. Refer youtube video to understand the process.

2. **Make Changes in the New Branch:**

   - Inside Visual Studio Code, create a folder named `day5`.
   - Inside the `day5` folder, add a file named `day5challenge.txt`.
   - Write the content "Day 5 task completed" inside the file.
   - Commit the changes with a meaningful message.

3. **View Branch Differences on GitHub Portal:**

   - Go to the GitHub repository portal.
   - Switch between the branches (main and day5) to understand the differences.

4. **Raise a Pull Request:**

   - Go to the "Pull Requests" tab on GitHub.
   - Create a new pull request, setting the base branch as `main` and the compare branch as `day5`.
   - Add a meaningful title and description.
   - Create the pull request.

5. **Self-Approve the Pull Request:**
   - As a practice, you can self-approve the pull request.
   - Merge the pull request to move the changes from `day5` branch to the `main` branch.

### Explanation:

- **Branch Command (`git checkout -b`):**

  - Creates a new branch and switches to it.
  - Example: `git checkout -b day5`.

- **Pull Request:**
  - A request to merge changes from one branch to another.
  - Creates a discussion around the proposed changes.

### Story Time: The Chronicles of Branches

Think of branches as alternate timelines in your coding journey. Each branch is like a parallel universe where you can experiment without affecting the main storyline.
