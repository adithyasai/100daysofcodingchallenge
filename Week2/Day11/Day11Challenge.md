# Day 11: Introduction to CSS - Understanding the Basics and Integration Methods

## Understanding What CSS Is and How It Works with HTML
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to describe the look and format of a document written in HTML. It's what makes the web look good.

## Why CSS?
CSS allows for a consistent look across multiple web pages, controls the layout of multiple pages at once, and provides a way to set presentation characteristics.

## Understanding the Syntax of CSS
The syntax for CSS is straightforward:
```css
selector {
  property: value;
}
```

## How to Add CSS
- **External CSS**: Link an external `.css` file within your HTML.
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
```
- **Internal CSS**: Place CSS in a `<style>` tag within the `<head>` section of your HTML.
```html
<style>
p {
  color: red;
}
</style>
```
- **Inline CSS**: Apply styles directly with the `style` attribute of HTML elements.
```html
<p style="color: blue;">This is a paragraph.</p>
```

## Assessment: Enhance Your Restaurant Menu
