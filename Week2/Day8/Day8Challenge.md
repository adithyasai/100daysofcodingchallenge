# Day 8: Introduction to HTML

## What is HTML?
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML defines the structure and layout of a web document by using a variety of tags and attributes.

## Basic Structure of an HTML Document
An HTML document has a basic structure that includes the `<html>` tag, the `<head>` section, and the `<body>` section. Here's a simple example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## What is a Tag?
Tags are the building blocks of HTML. They define the structure of the webpage and instruct the browser on how to display the content. Most tags have an opening and a closing part, e.g., `<p>` and `</p>` for a paragraph.

## `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declaration of HTML Version
The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration defines the HTML version to ensure the browser renders the content correctly. It should be the first line in an HTML document.

## Elements of an HTML Document
- `<html>`: The root element of an HTML page.
- `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the HTML document.
- `<title>`: Sets the title of the HTML document (displayed in the browser tab).
- `<body>`: Contains the content of the HTML document.

## Text Formatting
- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Headings from largest to smallest.
- `<p>`: Paragraph.
- `<br>`: Line break.
- `<hr>`: Horizontal rule.
- `<b>` : Bold tag

## Lists
- `<ul>`: Unordered list.
- `<ol>`: Ordered list.
- `<li>`: List item.

### Assignment:
## Building a Restaurant Menu Website
This week, we'll apply what we learn each day towards building a simple website for a restaurant menu. Using today's topics, we can start by setting up the basic structure of our menu webpage, including the document type, head, and body sections. We can also use headings to denote different sections of the menu (e.g., Appetizers, Main Courses, Desserts) and paragraphs or lists to detail the dishes available. Here's a basic example to get us started:
