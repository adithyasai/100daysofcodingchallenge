## Day 9: Working with Links, Images, Forms, and Tables in HTML

### Links
Use the `<a>` tag to create clickable hyperlinks to other documents or resources.

**Example:**
```html
<a href="https://www.your-restaurant.com">Visit Our Restaurant</a>
```

### Images
Embed images in an HTML page using the `<img>` tag. Use the `src` to specify the image path and `alt` for accessibility text.

**Example:**
```html
<img src="menu-item.jpg" alt="Delicious Spaghetti Bolognese">
```

### Forms
HTML forms are created with the `<form>` tag, which can collect user input and send it to a server.

**Example:**
```html
<form action="submit-review.php" method="post">
  <input type="text" name="customer_name" placeholder="Your Name">
  <textarea name="review" placeholder="Write your review here..."></textarea>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit Review">
</form>
```

### Tables
Tables are made using the `<table>` tag, with `<tr>` for rows, `<th>` for header cells, and `<td>` for data cells.

**Example:**
```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Dish</th>
    <th>Price</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Grilled Salmon</td>
    <td>$20.99</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Caesar Salad</td>
    <td>$9.99</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

### Assignment
Today's challenge is to enhance our restaurant's HTML page by adding interactive and engaging features. These tasks will make our menu more user-friendly and visually appealing.

## Tasks
- Create Anchor Tags for Dishes: Each dish on the menu should have an anchor tag, allowing users to click and view more details.

- Add Images to Dishes: Enhance the menu by adding images of the dishes to give customers a visual taste of what they can expect.

- Create a Review Form: Implement a form where customers can submit their reviews, providing valuable feedback about their dining experience.
