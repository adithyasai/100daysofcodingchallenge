### Day21 Assessment: Simple Contact Management System

#### Objective:
Build a simple contact management system in JavaScript that allows the user to add, view, and search for contacts. This console-based project will incorporate variables, control flow, arrays, functions, scope, and OOP concepts.

#### Requirements:

1. **Data Structure**: Use an array to store contacts. Each contact can be an object with properties like `name`, `email`, and `phone`.

2. **Adding Contacts**: Implement a function to add new contacts to the array.

3. **Viewing Contacts**: Implement a function to display all contacts in the console.

4. **Searching Contacts**: Implement a function to search for a contact by name and display the details.

5. **Use ES6 Classes**: Define a `Contact` class with a constructor and methods for setting and getting contact details.

#### Additional assessment (optional):
Extend the system with the following features:

1. **Update Contact**: Add a function to update the details of an existing contact.
2. **Delete Contact**: Implement a function to remove a contact from the array based on the name.
3. **Use Arrow Functions**: Wherever applicable, refactor your functions to use ES6 arrow syntax for more concise code.
4. **Incorporate Closures**: Use closures to encapsulate the logic for managing contacts, providing a clear structure and privacy for the contacts array.
