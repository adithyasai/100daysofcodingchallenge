# Variables and Data Types

Welcome to Day 2 of our Python exploration! Today, we'll dive into the world of variables and data types in Python. We'll cover the basics of declaring variables, working with strings and numbers, and performing fundamental operations with these data types.

## Variables in Python

Variables are containers for storing data values. In Python, you can create a variable and assign a value to it using a simple syntax:

```python
# Variable declaration and assignment
variable_name = value
```

Let's explore the different data types Python supports:

### Strings

Strings represent textual data and are enclosed in single or double quotes.

```python
name = "John"
message = 'Hello, Python!'
```

### Numbers

Python supports various numeric types, including integers and floats.

```python
integer_number = 42
float_number = 3.14
```

### Basic Operations with Variables and Data Types

Now, let's perform some basic operations with the variables and data types we've declared:

#### String Operations

```python
# Concatenation
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name

# String Length
name_length = len(full_name)
```

#### Numeric Operations

```python
# Addition
sum_result = integer_number + float_number

# Subtraction
difference_result = float_number - integer_number

# Multiplication
product_result = integer_number * float_number

# Division
division_result = float_number / integer_number
```

## Exercise

Create a Python script that declares variables representing your age, height (in meters), and your first name. Perform the following operations:

1. Concatenate your first name with a greeting message and print the result.
2. Calculate the square of your age and print the result.
3. Calculate your BMI (Body Mass Index) using the formula: BMI = weight / (height * height), assuming your weight is 70 kg. Print the result.

Feel free to customize the values and operations based on your preferences. Run the script in your VSCode environment and observe the output. Enjoy coding! ðŸš€ #Day2ofPython #100DaysofCodingChallenge #PythonVariables
