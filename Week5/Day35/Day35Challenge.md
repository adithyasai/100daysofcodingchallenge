# Comprehensive Python Exercise

## Objective

Apply your knowledge gained from Day 1 to Day 6 by completing a comprehensive exercise that combines various Python concepts.

## Exercise

**Task 1: Data Representation**

Create a Python program to represent information about a library. Utilize variables, data types, lists, and dictionaries to organize the data efficiently.

```python
# Information about the library
library_name = "Pythonic Library"
library_location = "Cityville"

# List of books available in the library
books = [
    {"title": "Introduction to Python", "author": "John Python", "genre": "Programming"},
    {"title": "Python for Beginners", "author": "Alice Coder", "genre": "Programming"},
    {"title": "Mystery of Pythonic Code", "author": "Sherlock Hacker", "genre": "Mystery"},
]

# Dictionary representing the library staff
library_staff = {
    "librarian": {"name": "Eva Librarian", "age": 35, "role": "Librarian"},
    "assistant": {"name": "Alex Assistant", "age": 28, "role": "Assistant Librarian"},
}
```

**Task 2: Control Flow**

Implement control flow statements to create logic for the following scenarios:

- If a book's genre is "Programming," print a message indicating its relevance to programming enthusiasts.
- Use a loop to print information about each book in the library.

**Task 3: Functions and Dictionaries**

Define a function called `print_staff_info` that takes a staff dictionary as a parameter and prints their information in a formatted manner. Then, use this function to display information about the librarian.

**Task 4: User Interaction**

Ask the user to input their favorite book genre. Check if the library has any books in that genre and print the titles if available. If not, inform the user that the library doesn't have books in that genre.

## Assessment

- Your program should display information about the library, books, and staff.
- It should correctly implement control flow statements for book genres and looping through book information.
- The `print_staff_info` function should format and display staff information correctly.
- The user interaction part should appropriately handle input and provide relevant information.

Feel free to customize and expand upon this exercise to showcase your understanding of the concepts learned from Day 1 to Day 6. Run the program in your VSCode environment and observe the results. Happy coding! ðŸš€ #PythonComprehensiveExercise #100DaysofCodingChallenge
