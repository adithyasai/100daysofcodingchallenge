## Day 43: Understanding Databases

### Introduction to Databases

A database is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It's like a virtual filing cabinet where data is stored in a structured way so that it can be retrieved and used by applications and services.

### Types of Databases

There are primarily two types of databases: 

- **Relational Databases**: These use a structure that allows us to identify and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database. Data is organized into tables with rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet. SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to manage and query data in these databases. Examples include SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.

- **Non-relational Databases**: Also known as NoSQL databases, these are more flexible in terms of data storage. They don't require a fixed schema and are designed to handle large volumes of data and horizontal scaling. They come in various types such as document, key-value, wide-column, and graph databases. Examples include MongoDB, Redis, and Cassandra.

### Basic Database Terminology

- **Tables**: In relational databases, tables are like individual spreadsheets within a workbook. Each table holds data about a specific object, such as customers or orders.
  
- **Rows**: A row, also known as a record, is a single entry in a table. Think of it like a line item in a spreadsheet that contains all the information about one specific thing, like a single customer.

- **Columns**: A column in a database table is like a column in a spreadsheet. Each column holds a certain kind of data about all the items in the table, such as the name or age of customers.

### Real-Life Example: Online Store

Imagine an online store with a database that has a table for `Customers`, another for `Orders`, and another for `Products`. Each table has rows and columns specific to the information it needs to store. For instance, the `Customers` table may have columns for customer ID, name, email, and phone number.

### Assignment: Explore an Online Store's Database

Your task is to sketch out a simple database for an online store with at least three tables: Customers, Orders, and Products. Identify the columns you would include in each table.
